Beginner Problems (Great for absolute beginners or to solidify basics)
__________________________________
Problem 1: Even or Odd Checker 
Description: Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer. Then, print whether the number is "Even" or "Odd".
Concepts to Practice: input(), int(), if/else statements, modulo operator (%).

Ans-
x = int(input("enter the number:"))

y = x % 2 

if y == 1:
    print("Number is odd")
else:
 print("Number is even")

-----------------------------------------------
Problem 2: Simple Calculator

Description: Create a program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) from the user. Perform the corresponding calculation and print the result. Include error handling for division by zero and invalid operators.
Concepts to Practice: input(), int() or float(), if/elif/else, basic arithmetic operators, error handling (try/except for division by zero).
   
    x = int(input("enter the first number:"))
    operator = input("Enter the operator(+, -, *, /):")
    y = int(input("enter the second number:"))
    if operator == '+':
        result =  x + y
    elif operator == '-':
        result =  x - y
    elif operator == '/':
        result =  x/y
    elif operator == '%':
        result =  x%y
    elif operator == '*':
        result =  x*y
    print("Result:", result)

----------------------------------------------

Problem 3: List Sum

Description: Given a list of numbers, write a function that returns the sum of all elements in the list.
Concepts to Practice: Functions, lists, for loop, sum() (can be used to check your manual loop sum).

def sum_list_numbers():

    x = [4,6,8,10,12,13,15]
    y = sum(x)

    print("print the value",y)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 4: String Reverser

Description: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.
Concepts to Practice: Functions, strings, string slicing ([::-1]), or for loops with concatenation.

def string():
    s = "Jindagi"
    return s[::-1]

result = string()

print("reverse_string:",result)
----------------------------------------------

Problem 5: Factorial Calculator

Description: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer. (Factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120).
Concepts to Practice: Functions, for loop, if statements (for base case 0! = 1).
Intermediate Problems (Building on basics, introducing more complex structures)
Problem 6: Palindrome Checker

Description: Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters).
Concepts to Practice: Functions, strings, string methods (.lower(), .isalnum()), loops or slicing.
Hint: Convert the string to lowercase and remove non-alphanumeric characters first.
Problem 7: Simple Guessing Game

Description: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user has a limited number of tries (e.g., 5 or 10) to guess the number. After each guess, tell the user if their guess was too high, too low, or correct.
Concepts to Practice: random module (random.randint()), while loop, if/elif/else, break, input().

Problem 8: Count Vowels and Consonants

Description: Write a function that takes a string and returns a dictionary containing the count of vowels and consonants in the string (case-insensitive).
Concepts to Practice: Functions, strings, dictionaries, for loop, string methods (.lower(), .isalpha()).

------------------------------------
Problem 9: File Word Counter

Description: Write a program that takes a text file's name as input. Read the file and count the frequency of each word. Print the top 5 most frequent words and their counts.
Concepts to Practice: File I/O (open(), read(), readlines()), strings, string methods (.split(), .lower(), .strip(), .replace()), dictionaries, collections.Counter (for an elegant solution), sorting.
Hint: Remember to handle punctuation.

---------------------------------------------------
Problem 10: To-Do List Manager (Console-based)

Description: Create a simple command-line to-do list application. It should allow users to:
Add a task.
View all tasks.
Mark a task as completed.
Delete a task.
Exit.
Concepts to Practice: Lists, while loop (main menu loop), input(), if/elif/else, list methods (.append(), .pop(), indexing), functions for each action.
Hint: Store tasks as strings in a list. You might use another list or modify the task string to indicate completion (e.g., "Buy milk [COMPLETED]").
How to Practice Effectively:
Read the Problem Carefully: Understand exactly what's being asked.
Plan (Pseudocode): Before writing code, jot down the steps you'll take in plain English.
Write Code: Implement your plan.
Test: Run your code with different inputs to ensure it works correctly, including edge cases (e.g., empty strings, zero, negative numbers if applicable).
Debug: If it doesn't work, use print() statements or a debugger to find out why.
Refactor (Improve): Once it works, look for ways to make your code more readable, efficient, or robust.


solution:

tasks = []
    
def add_task():
    task_name = input("Enter the task: ")
    tasks.append({"task": task_name, "completed": False})
    print("Task added!")

def view_tasks():
    if not tasks:
        print("No task found")
        return
    print("\n your taks:")
    for i, t in enumerate(tasks, 1):
        status = "‚úÖ" if t["completed"] else "‚ùå"
        print(f"{i}.{t['task']} [{status}]")

def mark_completed():
    view_tasks()
    try:
        task_num = int(input("enter task number to mark as completed: "))
        if 1 <= task_num <= len(tasks):
            tasks[task_num -1] ["completed"] =  True
            print("‚úÖtask marked as completed")
        else:
            print("! invalid task number")
    except ValueError:
        print("! Please enter a valid number")

def delete_task():
    view_tasks()
    try:
        task_num = int(input("Enter task number to delete: "))
        if 1 <= task_num <= len(tasks):
            deleted = tasks.pop(task_num - 1)
            print(f"üóëÔ∏è Deleted task: {deleted['task']}")
        else:
            print("‚ùó Invalid task number.")
    except ValueError:
        print("‚ùó Please enter a valid number.")

def main():
    while True:
        print("\n==== TO-DO LIST MENU ====")
        print("1. Add task")
        print("2. view task")
        print("3. Mark Task as Completed")
        print("4. Delete Task")
        print("5. Exit")
    
        choice = input("choose the option (1-5):")

        if choice == "1":
            add_task()
        elif choice == "2":
            view_tasks()
        elif choice == "3":
            mark_completed()
        elif choice == "4":
            delete_task()
        elif choice == "5":
            print("üëã Exiting the app. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("‚ùó Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 5.")
